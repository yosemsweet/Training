Customer Segment Examples:

Here are a few customer segment examples that I've used in the past - these represent a couple of iterations through the customer segment iteration cycle:

* We're targeting people who want to share their knowledge with others but don't know how to reach a broad audience because we think they'll be excited about the traffic they can get at Suite101
* We're targeting writers with journalism backgrounds who are now unemployed because they are looking to establish a career online and need to learn what the online writing industry is about

Here are a couple other examples from Cindy Alvarez' "The Experience is the Product"
* We’re targeting product managers because they get raises/bonuses based on solving this problem.
* We’re looking at medium-sized companies because they have budget allocated for solving this problem but are still nimble enough to try new solutions.
* We will talk to people whose primary concern is saving money because we think that goal aligns best with our solution.
